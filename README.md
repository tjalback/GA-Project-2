# GA-Project-2
Analysis of 2 Bikeshare companies 

This project and analysis was part of a General Assembly Data Analytics Immersion course I completed early 2021. 

Our goal was to use our newly learned SQL skills to answer a set of business questions. We used PGAdmin querying a database set up for this project. 

I selected Divvy in Chicago and Bluebikes in Boston as they both had similar datasets over a number of years, making it easy to compare and draw useful insights.

I've added a file with the raw SQL queries, a PDF document with questions and responses and an Excel file with the raw data, analyses and charting. 

I present my analysis (limited to 4-5 mins per project guidelines) in this short video: https://youtu.be/RIBOYMDOZ2E

Cheers!
